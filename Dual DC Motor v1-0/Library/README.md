SPI_Motor
==========

This is a library for Hootie81's Dual DC Motor controller shield for the Spark Core

To use with Spark web IDE:

1. Create new APP (.ino automatically added by IDE)
2. Create a new set of tabs with the name "SPI_Motor" (which will create SPI_Motor.h and SPI_Motor.cpp)
3. Copy the code from the github files into the corresponding tabs (.h and .cpp)
4. Copy the code from github file Demo.ino into the .ino tab, writing over anything already in the tab
5. Verify the code
6. Enjoy!
